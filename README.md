# aurl

A [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)/AMD loader plugin for accessing the absolute url of a specified file regardless
whether it's defined via a relative path.

This is a pretty dumb plugin. I would only use it if you're feeling lazy.

Known to work in RequireJS on the client only but does nothing during build.
